## Overview

[Localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) is a method of simulating an AWS environment locally.
This can be used to bypass the requirement of a remote sandbox environment, making testing easier.


### Implementation Details
- Some features and not present, and some are locked behind the [Pro Version](https://localstack.cloud/#pricing).
  - RDS is not present, but testing can be done with a local database.
- Can be run in a Docker container using Docker Compose.
- Can be run directly via a docker command.
:::tip
  ```
  docker run --rm -p 4566:4566 -p 4571:4571 localstack/localstack
  ```
:::
:::tip
Docker's localhost can be accessed on the parent machine at http://host.docker.internal
:::
- Most services are accessible on port 4566, and starting the image lists them individually.
- Data is not persisted between runs of the image.
  - S3 Bucket contents can be preserved by adding the following to [docker-compose.yaml](https://git.cr.usgs.gov/LPDA/appeears/-/blob/feature/rds-setup/deployment/localstack/docker-compose.yaml)
    ```
    DATA_DIR=/tmp/localstack/data
    volumes: localstack-col:/tmp/localstack
    ```
- There currently is no page for services running in localstack.
:::tip
[Commandeer](https://www.getcommandeer.com) could theoretically be used to provide a UI, but make sure it is approved by IT.
:::
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [botocore3](https://github.com/boto/botocore) can both contact Localstack if properly [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
  - AWS credentials are not checked, and can therefore be dummy values.
  - Most commands work, including those for creating, modifying, and listing services. For example:
    - Localstack In Docker:
    ```commandline
    aws --endpoint-url=http://host.docker.internal:4566 s3 ls
    ```
    - Localstack Running Locally:
    ```commandline
    aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 ls
    ```
  - Presently we are unsure if an AWS CLI profile pointing to Localstack precludes the need for '--endpoint-url'.
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) can be used to deploy to Localstack.
  - Since credentials are not checked, 'access_key' and 'secret_key' can be dummy values.
  - Since full permissions are granted be default, 'lambda-vpc-role' can also be a dummy value.
  - Terraform must be informed of Localstack's ports for services.
    ```
    provider "aws"{
      endpoints {
        s3 = "http://host.docker.internal:4566"
      }
    }
    ```

### Setup details
:::important
Make sure you have Docker desktop installed in your laptop and approved by your local IT and security team.
:::

- There are two ways to install localstack- either directly using docker command or by running a docker-compose.yaml file. The recommended way is by using docker compose since all changes will stay in one config file that can be changed according to use cases.
#### Docker compose

A sample docker-compose.yml file is shown below: 
```yaml
    version: "3.8"

    services:
      localstack:
        container_name: localstack-container
        image: localstack/localstack
        ports:
          - "53:53"
          - "443:443"
          - "4566:4566"
          - "4571:4571"
        environment:
          - DEBUG=1
          - DATA_DIR=/tmp/localstack/data # Local directory for saving persistent data
          - DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
          - LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=local #running lambda from local dir
          - LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER=0
          - DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
          - HOST_TMP_FOLDER=/tmp/localstack
        volumes:
          - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
```


From the command line, run `docker compose up` from within the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file shown above to start localstack.

```commandline
    C:\Users\test\localstack-test>docker compose up
    [+] Running 2/1

```


Localstack is now running in docker. To verify that the services are running, check the link http://localhost:4566/ should show a status of "running".
Open the docker desktop and click on the container's CLI to open the container.
Install the AWS CLI to run CLI commands in the docker container.

:::tip
`awslocal` is a thin wrapper around the AWS CLI for use with LocalStack. This
prevents the need for specifying `--endpoint-url` every-time the AWS CLI
command is run. To install `awslocal`, run:
`pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org awscli-local`
:::

### Examples of AWS services deployed using localstack
Some examples of CLI commands and their corresponding outputs are shown below.

### Deploying AWS resources using terraform and localstack

Terraform can also be used to deploy and test AWS resources locally using localstack. Make sure to have Terraform installed on your local machine. An example of deploying services like lambda, API gateway, SQS, S3 and SNS is shown below:
```commandline
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-east-1"
      access_key = "123"
      secret_key = "xyz"
      skip_credentials_validation = true
      skip_requesting_account_id = true
      skip_metadata_api_check = true
      s3_force_path_style = true
      endpoints {
        s3 = "http://localhost:4566"
        sqs = "http://localhost:4566"
        apigateway = "http://localhost:4566"
        lambda = "http://localhost:4566"
        sns = "http://localhost:4566"
        secretsmanager = "http://localhost:4566"
        iam = "http://localhost:4566"
      }
    }
    #-------------------------------- resources-------------------
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "localstack-test-bucket" {
      bucket = "localstack-test-bucket"
    }
    resource "aws_sqs_queue" "localstack-test-sqs" {
      name                      = "localstack-test-sqs"
      tags = {
        Environment = "dev"
      }
    }

    resource "aws_api_gateway_rest_api" "localstack-rest-api" {
      name = "localstack-rest-api"
    }

    resource "aws_api_gateway_resource" "localstack-rest-api-resource" {
      parent_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.localstack-rest-api.root_resource_id
      path_part   = "test"
      rest_api_id = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.localstack-rest-api.id
    }

    resource "aws_lambda_function" "test_lambda" {
      filename      = "test.zip"
      function_name = "localstack-lambda"
      role          = aws_iam_role.localstack-role.arn
      handler       = "test.lambda_handler"
      source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("test.zip")
      runtime = "python3.7"
    }

    resource "aws_sns_topic" "localstack-sns-topic" {
      name = "localstack-sns-topic"
    }

    resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "localstack-secret" {
      name                    = "localstack-secret"
      recovery_window_in_days = 0
    }

    data "aws_iam_policy_document" "localstack_policy" {
      statement {
        actions   = ["*"]
        effect    = "Allow"
      }
    }

    resource "aws_iam_role" "localstack-role" {
      name               = "localstack-role"
      assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.localstack_policy.json
    }
```
Here is the output after running `terraform apply`
```commandline
    Output:
    Plan: 6 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.

### IDE for Localstack
- Currently, there is an IDE named [Commandeer](https://getcommandeer.com/) that can be used to maintain localstack environments but requires a licensed premium version of the software to use. This could be something to look into in the future if we plan to buy a premium version.

### Known Limitations
- While commonly used AWS services are present, some more uncommon services are not.
- Is not a total replacement for AWS Sandbox testing.
  - Security checks are not present.
  - Is, by its nature, a simulation.

### Future Direction
- Localstack in a Docker container would be an excellent place to deploy ORCA for local testing.
- Could also be used for automated large testing in Bamboo if deployment scripting can be added.
